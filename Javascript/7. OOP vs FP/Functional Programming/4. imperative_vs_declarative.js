// Imperative code tells machine what to do and how to do it
// Declarative code tells machine what to do and what should happen

// A computer is better at being imperative
// Humans are declarative

// Machine code is very imperative
// Higher language becomes more declarative

// for loops
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// the above code is imperative, declare and then loop and do increment

[].forEach((item) => console.log(item)); // this is a lot more declarative

// jquery is a lot more imperative than what we have in js frameworks
// we told our website what to do

// react is lot more declarative
