// there are many tools but why ts?

// there is flow, elm, reasonml and obviosuly ts

// reasonml and flow was created by facebook

// ts by microsoft

// but they all try and make js a statically typed js

/*

    Reason is based ona  progamming language called oakamel, and easy by js developers to pickup
    fb actually sues it some of their projects, and 50% of their messengers are in Reason
    It has a compiler


    Flow is used very commonly with react projects
    Flow is able to add types in js, by writing codes that works with flow, and putting it in compiler like Babel
    Babel takes es6 and es7 code and changes it to es5 so all browsers can understand it
    Flow is a static type checker
    we are actually sth like this at top of files

    // @flow

    Flow will say this file has flow types, and i will check it for you
    It then relies on Babel to remove all that types
    it comes pre-built in react app

*/

/*

    Ts differs from flow in as it has its own compiler
    It is a superset of js
    it just adds few extra features on top of js

    Ts differs from reason in as reason is a completely different language on its own

    Elm is pretty much same as ReasonMl

    JUST FOCUS ON TYPESCRIPT or FLOW!!!!!

    Growth of TS outweighs all other.

    React community is also going towards TS.
