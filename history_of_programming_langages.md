1.  Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages
2.  The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.
3.  The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951
4.  The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 by a team led by John Backus at IBM.
5.  During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of historians as the world's first published computer program.
6.  Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages, for describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first programming language.
7.  In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.
8.  Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of "a new language for algorithms"; the ALGOL 60 Report (the "ALGOrithmic Language"). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:
    - nested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into blocks without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures;
    - lexical scoping: a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, that is, information hiding.
9.  C, an early systems programming language, was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973.
10. The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages.
11. JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser.
12. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP.
13. Many "rapid application development" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE, garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal, Objective Caml, Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention.
