/*
    Why dont we add all variables globally, to make code simple?
    There are issues with polluting the global space
    1.  we have limited memory!
    eventually it makes things slower and slower and eventually it crashes

    also there is another issue

    2.  we can have variable collisions!

    if we have different script files with same variable names
