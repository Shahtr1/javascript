/*

    In dynamically types language, type checking is done at runtime.

    Statically typed language are self documented
    becoz of this, it helps with auto-completion
    less bugs in production
    But we have cons
    1.  We are just adding another layer to our programs
    2.  Why cant you just write better tests?
    3.  Slower development process
    
    function sum(a: number, b: number) {
        return a + b;
    }
